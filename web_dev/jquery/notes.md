I like to do a video dive first. I'll do a quick YouTube search and find a video that is a full overview, for around an hour or so, then watch it on 1.5x or 2x speed to take it all in quick. Then I might watch a few more short videos on something I heard about in the video that I didn't fully understand. I like to do it all at once and just take it all in.

Videos are great for me to get an overall view.
